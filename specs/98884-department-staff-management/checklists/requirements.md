## Notes

- Validation completed in one review iteration.
- The specification deliberately separates F03 organizational management from F01 account management, F02 service management, F05 application workflow, F06 audit presentation, and F07 operational application search.
- The authorization default follows least privilege: Super Admin manages the complete Department lifecycle; Manager manages Staff only within departments they lead.
